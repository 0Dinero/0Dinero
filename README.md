Hey my name is "Dinero" im a software-developer with my main language as Python 
the reason i learned python was because i wanted a simple and non-buggy language unlike c, c++ and c#
however i still like and use c, c++ and c# because its great for other purposes than making software
i use the c-languages for addons to other applications.

</> - been a developer since i was 10

</> - i have a coding-experience of 6 years

</> - i can remembmer and write codes with these languages = (Python, C, C++, C#, JAVASCRIPT)

</> - the first code i ever made was a discord-bot made in javascript

</> - i made my first python script the 2/4/2021 - 01:00 in the night

Wanna contact me?
